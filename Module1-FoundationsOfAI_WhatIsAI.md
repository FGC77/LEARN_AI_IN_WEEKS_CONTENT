# **Summary: Foundations of AI (Module 1\)**

## **What is AI?**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, perception, problem-solving, and language understanding. AI encompasses both theoretical approaches and practical applications, making it a transformative technology in many fields.

### **Key Characteristics of AI:**

* **Autonomy:** Systems operate without constant human oversight.  
* **Adaptability:** Ability to learn from data and improve over time.  
* **Human-like Tasks:** Performing tasks such as speech recognition, image processing, and decision-making.

### **AI in Action:**

1. **Voice Assistants:** Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries.  
2. **Self-driving Cars:** AI processes sensor data to navigate and make driving decisions.  
3. **Healthcare Diagnostics:** AI models analyze medical images to detect diseases like cancer.

## **History of AI**

The field of AI has evolved significantly since its inception in the mid-20th century.

### **Key Milestones:**

* **1940s-1950s:** Conceptual foundations laid with Alan Turing's "Turing Test," which measures a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.  
* **1956:** The Dartmouth Conference formally introduced AI as a research field.  
* **1980s:** Expert systems gained popularity, enabling computers to simulate human decision-making.  
* **2010s-Present:** Deep learning and neural networks revolutionized AI, achieving breakthroughs in areas like image recognition and language translation.

### **Challenges and Breakthroughs:**

* Early AI faced limitations due to insufficient computational power and data.  
* Advances in hardware (e.g., GPUs) and access to big data have propelled AI into mainstream applications.
