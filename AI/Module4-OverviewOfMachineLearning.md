# **Overview of Machine Learning (Module 4\)**

**Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)** Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming. It involves algorithms that identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions. The three main types of ML are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

## **Supervised Learning**

Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data, where the input and corresponding output are known.

* **How it Works:**

  * The algorithm learns to map inputs (features) to outputs (labels) using a training dataset.  
  * Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms.  
* **Common Algorithms:**

  * Linear Regression: Predicts continuous outcomes.  
  * Logistic Regression: Predicts binary outcomes (e.g., spam vs. not spam).  
  * Decision Trees: Models decisions with a tree-like structure.  
  * Neural Networks: Simulates human brain functionality for complex predictions.  
* **Applications:**

  * Email spam detection.  
  * Fraud detection in financial transactions.  
  * Image classification, such as recognizing handwritten digits.

## **Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning involves analyzing data without labeled outputs. It discovers hidden patterns or structures in the data.

* **How it Works:**

  * The algorithm explores data to identify clusters, relationships, or anomalies.  
  * Example: Grouping customers into segments based on purchasing behavior.  
* **Common Algorithms:**

  * Clustering: Groups data points based on similarity (e.g., k-means).  
  * Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces data complexity (e.g., PCA).  
* **Applications:**

  * Customer segmentation for targeted marketing.  
  * Anomaly detection in network security.  
  * Data visualization for exploratory analysis.

## **Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning trains an agent to make a sequence of decisions by rewarding desired actions and penalizing undesirable ones.

* **How it Works:**

  * The agent interacts with an environment and learns a policy to maximize cumulative rewards.  
  * Example: Training a robot to navigate a maze.  
* **Common Algorithms:**

  * Q-Learning: Uses a value-based approach to optimize actions.  
  * Deep Reinforcement Learning: Combines reinforcement learning with deep learning.  
* **Applications:**

  * Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo defeating human players).  
  * Robotics for task automation.  
  * Dynamic pricing in e-commerce.

## **Key Concepts in Machine Learning**

1. **Training, Validation, and Testing:**

   * Training: Teaches the model using a dataset.  
   * Validation: Evaluates model performance and tunes hyperparameters.  
   * Testing: Assesses the final model's performance on unseen data.  
2. **Overfitting and Underfitting:**

   * Overfitting: The model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.  
   * Underfitting: The model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.  
3. **Feature Engineering:**

   * Process of selecting and transforming data features to improve model performance.  
4. **Evaluation Metrics:**

   * Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.  
   * Precision and Recall: Metrics for classification models.  
   * Mean Squared Error (MSE): Metric for regression models.
