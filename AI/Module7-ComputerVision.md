# **Computer Vision (Module 7\)**

## **Overview of Computer Vision**

Computer Vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. By simulating human visual perception, CV has revolutionized industries ranging from healthcare to autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. It combines image processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques to analyze and extract meaningful information from images and videos.

## **Core Concepts in Computer Vision**

### **1\. Image Representation**

* **Pixels:** The smallest units of an image, containing color or intensity values.  
* **Color Spaces:**  
  * RGB: Red, Green, Blue channels for color representation.  
  * Grayscale: Single intensity channel for simplicity.  
  * HSV: Hue, Saturation, and Value for more intuitive color representation.  
* **Resolution:** The total number of pixels in an image, affecting its clarity.

### **2\. Image Processing Techniques**

* **Filtering:** Enhances or suppresses certain aspects of an image using convolutional kernels (e.g., edge detection).  
* **Edge Detection:** Highlights significant boundaries within an image. Algorithms include:  
  * Sobel operator  
  * Canny edge detection  
* **Thresholding:** Converts grayscale images to binary format by setting a pixel intensity threshold.  
* **Morphological Operations:** Manipulates binary images for noise removal or shape refinement (e.g., dilation, erosion).

### **3\. Features in Images**

* **Feature Extraction:** Identifies key attributes or patterns in an image.  
  * Examples: Edges, corners, blobs.  
* **Feature Descriptors:** Encodes the extracted features into vectors for machine learning tasks.  
  * Examples: SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF).

### **4\. Object Detection and Segmentation**

* **Object Detection:** Identifies and localizes objects within an image.  
  * Techniques: YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector).  
* **Image Segmentation:** Divides an image into regions or objects.  
  * Types:  
    * Semantic Segmentation: Labels every pixel by category.  
    * Instance Segmentation: Labels each object instance separately.

### **1\. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

CNNs are the backbone of modern CV applications. Key components include:

* **Convolutional Layers:** Apply filters to extract spatial features.  
* **Pooling Layers:** Reduce spatial dimensions to make computations efficient.  
* **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform classification tasks based on extracted features.  
* **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity (e.g., ReLU).

### **2\. Pre-Trained Models and Transfer Learning**

* **Pre-trained Models:** Models like VGG, ResNet, and Inception are trained on large datasets like ImageNet, enabling rapid deployment.  
* **Transfer Learning:** Adapts pre-trained models to new tasks with minimal training data.

### **3\. Advanced Architectures**

* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Used for sequential image data (e.g., video analysis).  
* **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):** Generate realistic images or augment datasets.  
* **Vision Transformers (ViT):** Leverage self-attention for image processing tasks.
