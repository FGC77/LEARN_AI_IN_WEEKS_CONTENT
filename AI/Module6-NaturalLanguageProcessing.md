# **Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Module 6\)**

## **Overview of NLP**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP bridges the gap between human communication and machine understanding, with applications ranging from chatbots to machine translation and sentiment analysis. Recent advancements, particularly with deep learning, have dramatically improved NLP capabilities, making it a cornerstone of modern AI.

## **Core Components of NLP**

### **Text Preprocessing**

1. **Tokenization:** Splitting text into individual units (tokens), such as words or sentences.  
2. **Stopword Removal:** Filtering out common but uninformative words like "is," "the," and "and."  
3. **Stemming and Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root forms (e.g., "running" to "run").  
4. **Normalization:** Converting text to a consistent format, such as lowercasing or removing punctuation.  
5. **Vectorization:** Converting text into numerical representations, enabling machine understanding. Common methods include:  
   * Bag-of-Words (BoW)  
   * Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)  
   * Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)

### **Linguistic Features**

1. **Syntax Analysis:**  
   * Parsing sentences to identify grammatical structures (e.g., dependency parsing).  
   * Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging to label words based on their grammatical role.  
2. **Semantics Analysis:**  
   * Understanding the meaning of words and sentences.  
   * Techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) for identifying entities (e.g., names, locations).  
3. **Pragmatics:**  
   * Analyzing context and intent in communication.

## **Modern NLP Techniques**

### **Traditional Models**

1. **n-grams:**  
   * Simple probabilistic models capturing the likelihood of word sequences.  
   * Limitation: Poor handling of long-range dependencies.  
2. **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):**  
   * Used for sequential tasks like POS tagging.  
3. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):**  
   * A topic modeling technique for identifying themes in text.

### **Deep Learning Models**

1. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**  
   * Suitable for sequential data but prone to vanishing gradients.  
   * Variants: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).  
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**  
   * Effective for sentence classification and text summarization.  
3. **Transformer Models:**  
   * Leverage self-attention mechanisms for parallel processing.  
   * Examples:  
     * **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** Contextual embeddings for various NLP tasks.  
     * **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):** Focused on language generation.  
     * **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):** Handles text-to-text tasks uniformly.
